# ICP RWA Pawn Platform

## Overview

This is a decentralized Real World Asset (RWA) pawning platform built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). The platform allows users to submit real-world assets for verification, receive instant liquidity through pawn loans, and participate in a marketplace for expired assets. The system combines traditional pawn shop functionality with modern blockchain technology to create a transparent, secure, and decentralized lending platform.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built using React with TypeScript, utilizing a modern component-based architecture. The application uses Wouter for client-side routing and TanStack Query for efficient data fetching and caching. The UI is constructed with shadcn/ui components built on top of Radix UI primitives, styled with Tailwind CSS for consistent design. The frontend follows a page-based routing structure with dedicated pages for home, dashboard, marketplace, bridge functionality, and admin panel.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is built with Express.js in TypeScript, providing RESTful API endpoints for all platform functionality. The server architecture includes middleware for request logging, error handling, and JSON parsing. The application uses a layered architecture with separate modules for database operations (storage), route handling, and server configuration. The backend serves both API endpoints and static files, with Vite integration for development hot reloading.

### Database Layer
The system uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL as the database solution, specifically configured for Neon Database hosting. The database schema includes tables for users, RWA submissions, pawn loans, marketplace assets, bids, transactions, and bridge transactions. The schema supports the complete lifecycle of asset pawning from submission through loan management to marketplace transactions. All tables include proper relationships and constraints to maintain data integrity.

### Authentication and User Management
User authentication is based on wallet addresses, providing a seamless Web3 experience. The system supports user registration and management through wallet connections, with additional profile information stored in the database. Admin users have elevated privileges for managing submissions and platform operations.

### File Upload and Storage
The platform integrates with Google Cloud Storage for secure file handling, supporting document uploads for certificates of authenticity, NFT representations, and physical documentation. The system uses Uppy for frontend file upload handling with support for drag-and-drop, progress tracking, and multiple file types.

### Asset Lifecycle Management
The platform implements a complete asset lifecycle from submission to final disposition. RWA submissions go through a review process by admin users, approved assets can be used as collateral for pawn loans with automated expiry tracking, and expired loans result in assets being listed on the marketplace for public bidding.

### Blockchain Integration
The system includes mock ICP blockchain integration with plans for full implementation. This includes wallet connectivity, transaction management, and cross-chain bridging functionality. The platform maintains transaction records and supports both ICP and traditional payment methods.

### Admin Dashboard
A comprehensive admin interface provides oversight of all platform operations including pending submissions review, active loan monitoring, marketplace oversight, and platform analytics. The admin panel includes approval workflows and reporting functionality.
